Our dream is finally realised in 2024 when we are able to plan a trip to Bangkok. We literally spent many days talking about where we would go and what activities we would participate in.\n\nWe quickly agreed some ground rules - we would focus on food, sightseeing and shopping (not necessarily in that order, but that would be my personal priorities). The opportunity came when we realised plane tickets to Bangkok were quite reasonable (not quite pre-COVID sale prices but okay) and we all quickly booked our flights. We then scoured around for properties to rent so that we can stay together as a group.\n\nWe decided initially to just visit Chieng Mai and Bangkok, but then we realised there were a lot of things to see in Chieng Rai and it would be rushed to do it as a day trip. We hired a private tour driver who planned an itinerary for us. Cat, who is half-Thai, took charge of planning our itinerary in Bangkok.\n\nI tried my best to lose weight before the trip, but unfortunately I completely failed in this endeavour so I boarded the plane feeling heavy.","trip":"Thailand 2024","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Thailand","title":"Thailand 2024","description":"Girl's trip to Thailand, visiting Chieng Rai, Chieng Mai and Bangkok.

Fortunately, at this hour of the day, with nearly 3 hours before our flight, the queue at the checkin counter was quite short, plus we had already checked in online the day before so we just needed to drop our bags. The girl behind the counter was Indonesian and she was very helpful and checked our luggage all the way to Chieng Mai. She also assisted us with boarding the lane.\n\n## AMEX Lounge\n\nAfter checkin, we headed to the AMEX Lounge. Unfortunately this was located on the opposite end of the airport relative to our boarding gate, so it's a bit of a walk to the lounge. Luckily Margaret had two spare lounge passes with her AMEX Card so we were able to enjoy the facilities of the lounge. I had my usual breakfast of bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages, baked beans, potatoes and toast plus a cup of coffee.\n\n![AMEX Lounge](../gallery/day-01-flight/02_AMEX_Lounge.webp)\n\n![AMEX Lounge](../gallery/day-01-flight/03_AMEX_Lounge.webp)\n\nWhen it was to boarding we headed towards the gate. Along the way, I saw a Gentle Monster shop at the airport. I saw a similar shop at TRX in Kuala Lumpur recently so I knew they were famous for their gigantic sculptures. I posed in front a giant rotating face and Margaret took a photo just when the face was looking at me.\n\n![Gentle Monster](../gallery/day-01-flight/05_Gentle_Monster.webp)\n\n## Boarding flight to Bangkok\n\nWe all met together as a group at the boarding gate for Thai Airways flight TG 476 to Bangkok. We were lucky in that some of us were in Group 2 boarding, which is the first group to board after the premium passengers, so we entered the plane early and had plenty of cabin luggage space to put our bags.\n\n![Plane](../gallery/day-01-flight/04_Plane.webp)\n\n![Group](../gallery/day-01-flight/06_Group.webp)\n\n![Plane](../gallery/day-01-flight/07_Plane.webp)\n\nThe flight was uneventful and quite pleasant.

I watched two movies:\n\n- [Lovesick Ellie](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x95s79u): Eriko Ichimura (Nanoka Hara) has an ordinary and unnoticed student life at her high school. Her only joy is to watch popular male student Akira Omi (Nanoka Hara) and imagine them being a couple. She writes down those thoughts on her social media account under the name of Lovesick Ellie. Akira Omi seems like a perfect guy, with good looks and gentle personality. One day, she witnesses Akira Omi spouting vulgar language and she realizes he is kind of like a two-faced person. Making things worse, her fantasy thoughts are discovered by him. He thinks that she is funny and he approaches her.

Finding himself in a new era, approaching retirement, Indy wrestles with fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him. But as the tentacles of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy must don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\n\n## Bangkok stopover\n\nWe arrived in Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, in the afternoon and cleared customs. Since we had around three hours before the next flight to Chieng Mai, we wandered around the transit area and decided to have an early dinner at Thai Street Food. I had the tom yum noodle for 231 baht (around A$11) - it was delicious and surprisingly quite filling. The others had Thai chicken rice and BBQ Portk and wantan dry noodles.\n\n![Group](../gallery/day-01-flight/11_Group.webp)\n\n![Tom yum noodle](../gallery/day-01-flight/12_Tom_yum_noodle.webp)\n\n![Thai chicken rice](../gallery/day-01-flight/13_Chicken_rice.webp)\n\n![BBQ pork wantan noodle](../gallery/day-01-flight/14_BBQ_pork_wantan_noodle.webp)\n\n## Flight to Chieng Mai\n\nWe boarded TG 120 which departed just after 7pm and arrived about one hour later to Chieng Mai. We had no problems disembarking and claiming our baggage.

Across the Super Highway is [MAYA Lifestyle Shopping Center Chiangmai เมญ่า ไลฟ์สไตล์ ช้อปปิ้ง เซ็นเตอร์ เชียงใหม่](https://mayashoppingcenter.com).

In Thailand, the elephant is considered a sacred animal and is closely associated with Buddhism, the predominant religion in the country. The white elephant, in particular, is seen as a symbol of purity and spiritual power. It is believed to be a harbinger of good fortune and prosperity. The image of the elephant can be found in many temples and shrines across Thailand, where they are worshipped and offered food and water as a sign of respect.\n\n![Elephant Shrine](../gallery/day-02-maya/03_Elephant_Shrine.webp)\n\n![Elephant Shrine](../gallery/day-02-maya/04_Elephant_Shrine.webp)\n\n![Chris](../gallery/day-02-maya/10_Elephant_Shrine.webp)\n\nAlso nearby is a shrine full of roosters. The rooster holds a significant place in Thai culture, representing courage, strength, and vigilance. In Buddhism, the rooster symbolizes the dawn, heralding the arrival of a new day and the dispelling of darkness. It is believed making offerings to roosters will bring prosperity and business success.\n\n![Rooster shrine](../gallery/day-02-maya/08_Rooster_Shrine.webp)\n\n![Rooster shrine](../gallery/day-02-maya/09_Rooster_Shrine.webp)\n\nOpposite Maya on Huay Kaew Rd is trendy Think Park, which is a shopping and cafe space.\n\n![Think Park](../gallery/day-02-maya/20_Think_Park.webp)\n\nWe then walked west along Huay Kaew Rd and passed this golden arch:\n\n![Arch](../gallery/day-02-maya/12_Arch.webp)\n\nBeyond this is a trendy cafe called [Tiger TED Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php/?id=100055000754567).

The reliefs of the women also look a bit too sexy for this to be a true temple.\n\nStill, it would be a great location for a fashion photo shoot, or perhaps adventure game.\n\nI also found it a bit sad that someone has poured so much money into building this site, and some parts seem almost finished that I would have liked to see an operational version of this site.","trip":"Thailand 2024","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Wat Replica","title":"Day 3: Wat Replica","description":"Abandoned \"temple\" next to Thaweesin hot springs.","date":"2024-11-14T04:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/thailand-2024/_astro/16_Wat_Replica.dJCxxZX6.webp","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"webp"},"map":[19.11590011504812,99.46444166987092,17],"tags":["breakfast","fake","Angkor Wat","temple","abandoned"]},{"id":"day-03-4-doi-chaang","slug":"day-03-4-doi-chaang","base":"/thailand-2024/","collection":"post","body":"Doi Chaang is a venture partnering with the Akha hill tribe farmers of Northern Thailand in the Doi Chang village producing single origin specialty coffee beans and they have a cafe located next to their premises on the way to Chiang Rai called [DOI CHAANG Caffè - สาขาเชียงราย](https://doichaangcoffee.co.th/en/).\n\nUpon entering, we were greeted with a garden featuring a fountain and the building itself is reminiscent of tribal houses.\n\nThe menu here is international, but we ordered mainly Thai dishes.

Even the toilets are golden towers! Even though the photos don't show it - there were a lot of visitors, it was very crowded.

The temple really looks beautiful at night and it was truly magical.\n\nThe Blue Temple, or more formally [Wat Rong Suea Ten](https://www.tourismthailand.org/Attraction/wat-rong-suea-ten) (Thai: วัดร่องเสือเต้น), is a temple in Chiang Rai, Thailand, known for its striking modern artistic design. The temple's construction was initiated by the local community in 1996 to replace an old abandoned temple which previously stood on the site, though construction did not start until 2005. Its final design was realised by local artist Phuttha Kabkaew (พุทธา กาบแก้ว) or Sala Nok (สล่านก, sala being a northern Thai title for an artisan), who learned from Chalermchai Kositpipat while working on his famous Wat Rong Khun (White Temple). It is designed in an unconventional \"neo-traditional\" style of Buddhist art employing lavishly ornamented sculptures and psychedelic visual imagery.\n\nIt is very Instagrammable, and even though we arrived rather late, there were still plenty of tourists taking photos inside and outside the temple. We stepped out just before sunset and was able to obserbe the temple transform from it's daytime look to a truly magnificent iolluminated structure framed by the dying light of the sun.","trip":"Thailand 2024","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Blue Temple","title":"Day 3: Blue Temple Chiang Rai","description":"Another popular and Instagrammable modern temple at the best time of day - during sunset.","date":"2024-11-14T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/thailand-2024/_astro/27_Blue_Temple.ClVi3HZP.webp","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"webp"},"map":[19.923637262197804,99.84242066619379,17],"tags":["Chiang Rai","Blue Temple","temple","Wat Rong Suea Ten"]},{"id":"day-03-9-growhome","slug":"day-03-9-growhome","base":"/thailand-2024/","collection":"post","body":"Where we stayed in Chiang Rai - it's called [Grow Home-Stay and Space โรงแรมโกรวโฮม](https://www.facebook.com/growhomestayandspace/) and it's a trendy creative boutique hotel with communal living space and a studio and performance area so you can indulge in your creative expression should you have the urge.\n\nDownstairs appeared to be some sort of child care centre, the mid level has the kitchen and small library, the upper floor are where the rooms and, and finally the rooftop contains a studio and performance space.\n\nI shared a large king sized bed with Margaret in the two bedroom apartment, and Cat slept in the separate room with one bed.","trip":"Thailand 2024","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Grow Home","title":"Day 3: Grow Home","description":"We stayed overnight at this trendy accommodation in Chiang Rai.","date":"2024-11-14T15:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/thailand-2024/_astro/13_Performance_space.D1UVsoxE.webp","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"webp"},"map":[19.900977544302958,99.83562656804256,17],"tags":["Chiang Rai","accommodation","Grow Home"]},{"id":"day-03-8-lu-lam","slug":"day-03-8-lu-lam","base":"/thailand-2024/","collection":"post","body":"[Lulum Restaurant Chiang Rai ร้านอาหาร​ หลู้ลำ เชียงราย](https://www.facebook.com/RanXaharHluLaCheiyngray/) is a well known riverside restaurant serving Northern Thai food located next to the Kok River in Chiang Rai.

The Japanese regard Guanyin as a man and call him Kannon (fun fact: Canon camera was named after Kannon).
