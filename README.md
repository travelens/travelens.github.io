# Travels Through A Lens

My travelogue web site. This documents all the trips we have taken over the
years, to various countries.

This web site is written in HTML, CSS,
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[MarkDoc](https://markdoc.dev) using
[Astro](https://astro.build) as a web framework and static site generator.

It open source (MIT licence) and deployed using Github Pages.

The initial site design will be based on [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net) site
templates, particularly Eventually and Story.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ article.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

In addition, each trip will be stored as a separate repository in the
`travelens` organization. This project integrates all the individual
repositories into a single seamless website.
