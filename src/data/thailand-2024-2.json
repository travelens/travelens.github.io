Our dream is finally realised in 2024 when we are able to plan a trip to Bangkok. We literally spent many days talking about where we would go and what activities we would participate in.\n\nWe quickly agreed some ground rules - we would focus on food, sightseeing and shopping (not necessarily in that order, but that would be my personal priorities). The opportunity came when we realised plane tickets to Bangkok were quite reasonable (not quite pre-COVID sale prices but okay) and we all quickly booked our flights. We then scoured around for properties to rent so that we can stay together as a group.\n\nWe decided initially to just visit Chiang Mai and Bangkok, but then we realised there were a lot of things to see in Chiang Rai and it would be rushed to do it as a day trip. We hired a private tour driver who planned an itinerary for us. Cat, who is half-Thai, took charge of planning our itinerary in Bangkok.\n\nThis trip is so massive for the sake of optimising storage I have broken the trip to two parts. In Part 1, we fly from Sydney and arrive in Chiang Mai via Bangkok. We spent about a week in both Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, visiting a variety of locations and sampling food from many places.\n\nIn Part 2 the adventure continues in Bangkok as we fly from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and spent a week there including a side trip to Amphawa.","trip":"Thailand 2024 Part 2","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Thailand","title":"Thailand 2024 Part 2","description":"Part 2 of a long planned and awaited Girl's trip to Thailand, where we conclude the trip by spending 7 days in Bangkok.","date":"2024-11-26T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/thailand-2024-2/_astro/trip.MGFqZ6Lt.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg"},"tags":["Thailand","Bangkok"]},{"id":"day-08-1-flight","slug":"day-08-1-flight","base":"/thailand-2024-2/","collection":"post","body":"We checked out of the house we were staying, and took a van to Chiang Mai airport.

The temple and city half day tour includes the following:\n\n- Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha\n- Wat Pho (Reclining Buddha)\n- Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn)\n- Boat trip along the Klong (45-50 mins)\n\nThe first stop is [Wat Pho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Pho) (วัดโพธิ์).\n\nWat Pho is one of Bangkok's oldest temples. It existed before Bangkok was established as the capital by King Rama I. Our guide explained that King Rama I (Phra Bat Somdet Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok Maharat พระบาทสมเด็จพระพุทธยอดฟ้าจุฬาโลกมหาราช) was the founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom (now Thailand) and the first King of Siam from the reigning Chakri dynasty. He ascended the throne in 1782, following the deposition of King Taksin of Thonburi, who united Siam following the collapse of the Ayutthaya Kingdom but became mad in his later years (or so they say, perhaps they just wanted to get rid of him).\n\nKing Rama I decided to move the capital of Thailand from Thonburi to Bangkok, and decided to build the Grand Palace beside Wat Pho. He also decided to renovate Wat Pho. Originally, the temple site was named Wat Photaram or Podharam and it was renamed to Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangklavas. The temple complex continued to undergo changes over the next 200 years and was renamed Wat Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangklararm by King Rama IV.\n\nIt is home to more than one thousand Buddha images, as well as one of the largest single Buddha images at 46 metres (151 ft) in length. The Wat Pho complex consists of two walled compounds bisected by Chetuphon Road running in the east–west direction. The larger northern walled compound, the phutthawat, is open to visitors and contains the finest buildings dedicated to the Buddha, including the bot with its four directional viharn, and the temple housing the reclining Buddha. The southern compound, the sankhawat, contains the residential quarters of the monks and a school. The temple grounds contain four great chedis, 91 small chedis, two belfries, a bot (central shrine), a number of viharas (halls) and various buildings such as pavilions, as well as gardens and a small temple museum.\n\n![Group](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/02_Group.webp)\n\nA number of large Chinese statues, some of which depict Europeans, are also found in the complex guarding the gates of the perimeter walls as well as other gates in the compound. These stone statues were originally imported as ballast on ships trading with China. One of these is apparently Marco Polo.\n\n![The group with Chinese guardians at the gate](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/09_Group.webp)\n\nPhra Ubosot (Phra Uposatha) or bot is the ordination hall, the main hall used for performing Buddhist rituals, and the most sacred building of the complex. Inside the ubosot is a gold and crystal three-tiered pedestal topped with a gilded Buddha made of a gold-copper alloy, and over the statue is a nine-tiered umbrella representing the authority of Thailand. The Buddha image, known as Phra Buddha Theva Patimakorn, is thought to be from the Ayutthaya period.\n\n![Phra Buddha Theva Patimakorn](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/24_Phra_Buddha_Theva_Patimakorn.webp)\n\nPhra Rabiang is a double cloister contains around 400 images of Buddha from northern Thailand selected out of the 1,200 originally brought by King Rama I.\n\n![Buddhas](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/18_Buddhas.webp)\n\nThere are four towers, or phra prang, at each corner of the courtyard around the bot.\n\n![Phra Prang](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/21_Phra_Prang.webp)\n\nPhra Maha Chedi Si Rajakarn is a group of four large stupas, each 42 metres high. These four chedis are dedicated to the first four Chakri kings. The first, in green mosaic tiles, was constructed by Rama I to house the remnants of the great Buddha from Ayuthaya, which was scorched to remove its gold covering by the Burmese.\n\n![Phra Maha Chedi Si Rajakarn](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/13_Phra_Maha_Chedi_Si_Rajakarn.webp)\n\nOutside the Phra Rabiang cloisters are dotted many smaller chedis, called Phra Chedi Rai. They contain ashes of the royal family and also relics of the Buddha.\n\n![Phra Chedi Rai](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/10_Phra_Chedi_Rai.webp)\n\nThe wat and the reclining Buddha (Phra Buddhasaiyas, Thai: พระพุทธไสยาสน์) were built by Rama III in 1832. The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of all reincarnations. The posture of the image is referred to as sihasaiyas, the posture of a sleeping or reclining lion. The figure is 15 m high and 46 m long, and it is one of the largest Buddha statues in Thailand.\n\n![Phra Buddhasaiyas](../gallery/day-10-wat-pho/38_Phra_Buddhasaiyas.webp)","trip":"Thailand 2024 Part 2","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Wat Pho","title":"Day 10: Bangkok City Tour - Wat Pho","description":"Belinda, Margaret and I opted to take a private city tour of Bangkok organised by BoardingPass.

This brick plastered Throne Hall with a Prasad spired roof with red Garuda clutching the heads and seizing the tails of two Naga serpent statues at the four corners of the seven-tiered Maha Prasad roof replaced the Phra Thinang Indrabhisek Throne Hall that was built in wood and was destroyed in the fire that was caused by a lightning strike in 1789.\n\n![Dusit Maha Prasad Throne Hall](../gallery/day-10-grand-palace/099_Dusit_Maha_Prasad_Throne_Hall.webp)\n\nRama IV built the Abhorn Bimok Pavilion behind the west boundary wall of the Phrathinang Dusit Maha Prasad complex as a robing pavilion prior to mounting or after dismounting a palanquin.\n\n![Abhorn Bimok Pavilion](../gallery/day-10-grand-palace/101_Abhorn_Bimok_Pavilion.webp)","trip":"Thailand 2024 Part 2","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok","location":"Grand Palace","title":"Day 10: Bangkok Grand Palace","description":"Our second stop on the private city tour is the Grand Palace, the official residence of the Kings of Siam (and later Thailand) since 1782.","date":"2024-11-21T03:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/thailand-2024-2/_astro/098_Phra_Thinang_Chakri_Maha_Prasad.Da0bSNPa.webp","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"webp"},"map":[13.750053758286134,100.49164084832223,17],"tags":["Bangkok","tour","Grand Palace"]},{"id":"day-10-3-river-cruise","slug":"day-10-3-river-cruise","base":"/thailand-2024-2/","collection":"post","body":"Most tourists who visit Bangkok are of course aware of the Chao Phraya river, where a lot of Bangkok's attractions and hotels are located, but less have explored the complex and intricate network of small rivers and canals criss cross the city.\n\nAfter the Grand Palace, our guide hailed a river boat and we hopped on to it. I was very surprised how low the boat was, it felt like we were almost touching the water. But fortunately, the waters are quite calm. The river boat operator took us along the Chao Phraya river, but then ducked into a canal (Bangkok Noi) and soon we were exploring a side of Bangkok I have never seen before.\n\nWe passed through old communities along the canal banks where life seemed peaceful and far away from the bustling city. We also saw several temples, including one next to a statue of the Buddha where we could feed the catfish by throwing scraps of bread to the water.

The central spire symbolises Mount Meru from hindu cosmology which is considered to be the centre of all physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes.\n\nKing Taksin (1734–82), who established the Thonburi Kingdom following the fall of Ayutthaya, established his capital around Wat Arun and brought with him the Emerald Buddha (originally from Vientiane, Laos) - the Emerald Buddha as we know is now located at the Wat Ubosot in the Grand Palace,\n\nThe surrounding spires are devoted to the wind God, Phra Phai. The giant white figurine is Sahassa Deja and the giant green figurine is Thotsakan. The Giants (yaksha) face in four directions to offer protection. The central spire is topped with a seven pronged trident, known as \"Trident of Shiva\".
