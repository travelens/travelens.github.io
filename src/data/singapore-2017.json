The whole dome is covered in fine mist and felt very humid and lush, but cool due to the climate conditioning.\n\nWe started by exploring the base which had sculptures and orchids.\n\n[1]: http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en.html\n[2]: http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/attractions/cloud-forest/visitor-information.html\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Cloud Forest","title":"Day 3: Cloud Forest","description":"Cloud Forest is a fake mountain enclosed in a glass dome complete with waterfalls and treetop (and mountaintop) boardwalks.","date":"2017-11-10T01:00:41.000Z","image":{"src":"/undefined/_astro/Walkway.vK8iJ6Rm.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/singapore-2017/src/assets/gallery/3-cloud-forest-base/Walkway.jpeg"},"map":[1.28387,103.86604,18],"tags":["attraction","Cloud Forest","garden","Gardens by the Bay","Singapore"]},{"id":"3-flower-dome-continental-gardens.md","slug":"3-flower-dome-continental-gardens","base":"/undefined/","collection":"post","body":"\nIn the Flower Dome, we wandered through the different continental gardens such as the Australian Garden, South African Garden, South American Garden, Mediterranean Garden and Californian Garden and finally the Olive Grove.\n\n## Australian Garden\n\nTravel through the deserts of Australia and see the native floral in full bloom at the Australian Garden.\n\nIn a fascinating showcase of plants Western and South Australia that thrive in a cool-dry climate, discover how different species have adapted to survive the long dry seasons, and how some plants have even come to rely on fires to aid their reproduction.\n\n## South African Garden\n\nExplore a sea of colourful flowers, evergreen shrubs, succulents and bulbs as you walk through the South African landscape.\n\nSouth Africa is home to an amazing number of exclusive or endemic species, including ‘Fynbos’ plants. These species have needle-like leaves that form thickets of fire-prone, hard-leaf shrubs that grow in sandy, low-nutrient soil. Many of the plants found in this vegetation have small, dark leaves covered in a waxy outer layer that helps them to retain moisture.\n\n## South American Garden\n\nWander through the stunning Chilean Garden and be mesmerised by exotic plants from Central Chile, such as the Monkey Puzzle Tree and the Puya from the dry rock outcrops in central Chile, and the stunning formation of large specimens of Chilean Wine Palm on the terrace.\n\n## Californian Garden\n\nHead up the stairs and be welcomed by the colourful ‘Chaparral’ from the Californian Mediterranean region. Comprising mostly shrubs and a few trees, these plants are affected by natural fires that occur from time to time. Some of the plants also display aromatic, downy foliage to discourage herbivores from browsing on them.\n\n## Mediterranean Garden\n\nThe Mediterranean Basin is one of the first places in the world to practise agriculture, with crops such as olives, figs, grapes, wheat and lentils. This garden also showcases the region’s native plants, such as the Stone Pine or Date Palm. Don’t forget to stop by the waterfront and admire the beautiful row of Italian Cypresses, which is reminiscent of Lake Como in Italy.\n\n## Olive Grove\n\nOlives, figs, grapes, pomegranate and many other crops are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. Grown for thousands of years, they form an important part of the region’s identity and heritage. A photo in front of the magnificent 1000-year-old Olive Tree is a must before you leave the Olive Grove.\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Flower Dome","title":"Day 3: Flower Dome (Continental Gardens)","description":"We explored the Continental gardens including Australian, South African, South American, Mediterranean, Californian and the Olive Grove.","date":"2017-11-10T08:00:09.000Z","image":{"src":"/undefined/_astro/Sculpture (6).lxMNDBj7.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/singapore-2017/src/assets/gallery/3-flower-dome-continental-gardens/Sculpture (6).jpeg"},"map":[1.28453,103.86469,18],"tags":["attraction","Flower Dome","garden","Gardens by the Bay","Singapore"]},{"id":"3-flower-dome-flower-field.md","slug":"3-flower-dome-flower-field","base":"/undefined/","collection":"post","body":"\nThe changing floral displays in Flower Dome reflect different seasons, festivals, and themes.\n\nWhen we visited, the Flower Field had many Christmas decorations and displays\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Flower Dome","title":"Day 3: Flower Dome (Flower Field)","description":"Our final stop in the Flower Dome is the Flower Field.","date":"2017-11-10T09:00:09.000Z","image":{"src":"/undefined/_astro/Xmas (3).BUn-F-3i.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/singapore-2017/src/assets/gallery/3-flower-dome-flower-field/Xmas (3).jpeg"},"map":[1.28453,103.86469,18],"tags":["attraction","Flower Dome","garden","Gardens by the Bay","Singapore"]},{"id":"3-flower-dome-succulent.md","slug":"3-flower-dome-succulent","base":"/undefined/","collection":"post","body":"\nAfter vising the impressive Cloud Forest, we headed into the second of Gardens by the Bay&#8217;s gigantic domes.

We started by exploring the succulent garden and the Baobab garden. The former features some Alice in Wonderland sculptures.\n\nAs water-storing desert plants, succulents belong to families such as Cacti, Aloes and Crassulas. Look closer and you’ll find that many of these species have sharp spines to protect themselves. A dense cover of blue or grey wax over the surface of their leaves and stems also helps protect them from dehydration and deflect excess UV light in the desert.\n\nThe Baobab goes by several common names, this spectacular tree is also known as the Bottle Tree – a hat-tip to its peculiar-shaped trunk – and the Tree of Life, as it provides shelter, food and clothing for African savannah inhabitants. Other plants to look out for in the Flower Dome include the Drunken Tree, Ghost Tree, as well as African Baobab — the largest tree in the Gardens!\n\n[1]: http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/attractions/flower-dome/visitor-information.html\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Flower Dome","title":"Day 3: Flower Dome (Succulents and Boababs)","description":"Flower Dome is supposedly the largest glass greenhouse in the world.

It was built by a group of 11 business tycoons led by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing jointly invested in what was then Singapore’s biggest commercial development: Suntec City. Completed in 1997, the building’s design and architecture places heavy emphasis on _feng shui_ since Hong Kong people are known to be ardent believers in *feng shui*.\n\n[1]: https://sunteccity.com.sg\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Suntec City","title":"Day 6: Suntec City","description":"Suntec City is one of Singapore’s largest malls and shopping destination nestled in the heart of the bustling Marina Bay precinct.","date":"2017-11-12T21:00:01.000Z","image":{"src":"/undefined/_astro/Suntec City (2).C8DoF26F.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/singapore-2017/src/assets/gallery/6-suntec-city/Suntec City (2).jpeg"},"map":[1.2943,103.8592,16],"tags":["building","city","shopping","Singapore","Suntec City"]},{"id":"6-trick-eye-museum.md","slug":"6-trick-eye-museum","base":"/undefined/","collection":"post","body":"\n[Trick Eye Museum Singapore][1], is a 3D optical art museum originally from Korea, where one can pose in front of the art and take photos that appear to immerse the subject within artwork.

We started from the top and visited the LEGO Store. There is even a Leica Store. There are various sculptures located on each floor. Some of the interesting stores we visited include Tiffany, Gucci, Fendi, the TWG Tea House, Prada, Moncler, Dolce & Gabbana. There were some Christmas displays outside and we managed to take some photos even though it was drizzling. For lunch, we ate Teochew fish balls at the food court.\n\nWe also visited the [Tangs department store][5] across the road. We used to visit the CK Tang department store in the 1980s whenever we visited Singapore, so we always made it a point to revisit the store whenever we are in Singapore.\n\nWisma Atria is somewhat less high end than ION Orchard but had quite a few stores, including a Pablo Japanese cheesecake shop in the basement.\n\n[1]: http://www.ionorchard.com/en/\n[2]: http://www.wismaonline.com/?ch=english_home\n[3]: http://www.ngeeanncity.com.sg\n[4]: https://www.313somerset.com.sg\n[5]: https://www.tangs.com\n","trip":"Singapore 2017","place":"South East Asia","timezone":"Asia/Singapore","location":"Orchard Road","title":"Day 7: Orchard Road","description":"ast day in Singapore!
