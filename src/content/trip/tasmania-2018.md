We returned back to Tasmania on 1-5 May 2018 and mainly visited the [Freycinet National Park][1]&nbsp;and Hobart. Although I had sprained my left patellar tendon a few weeks prior to the trip, I was able to walk around without too much difficulty by the time we arrived at Tasmania (thank goodness). The trip was really enjoyable and we were very lucky because a week later Hobart was deluged by wild weather and strong rains and Macquarie St (where we stayed) was flooded!<figure class="wp-block-table alignfull is-style-stripes">
