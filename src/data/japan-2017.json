Ghibli Museum is a very popular museum and attracts many visitors a year. It focuses on the famous Studio Ghibli animated films.\nThe museum is located in Inokashira Park in Mitaka, a suburb of Tokyo. We caught a train there.\n\nWe had an eki bento (takeaway) at the railway station, and after that wasted huge amounts of time trying to find a rubbish bin to dispose the packaging. Finally gave up, went to the koban, and the police officer explained to me there are no public rubbish bins &#8211; we either need to take it home or find a convenience store.\n\nWent to the tourist centre they showed me the directions to 7-11 which fortunately had rubbish bins. Bought some iTunes cards there &#8211; these are hard to get outside of Japan and worth it so I can buy Japanese media when I return home.\n\nThe Ghibli museum was great, there were some new exhibits but it was less enthralling than when we first visited 9 years ago because a lot of it was the same. They have a strict no photos policy inside the museum which disappointed me, and they are a lot stricter in enforcing it than last time. Still, we had a good time and spotted our first full bloom cherry tree in the park outside the museum.\n\nOn the walk back to the station we passed by a zoo with lots of statues. It was getting quite chilly and we were now ravenous. Went the wrong direction when we got off the train but fortunately we realised our mistake after a block. Lots of food options including an unagi restaurant but we decided for tempura. It was the best tempura meal I have had and quite cheap too &#8211; the equivalent of Australian food court pricing for a sit down restaurant.\n\nFood seems to be cheaper than 9 years ago &#8211; I guess the impact of deflationary spiral economics that I struggled with in Advanced Japanese class has really taken effect. Despite that, the economy still seems okay &#8211; nothing compared to the shuttered and graffitied downtown stores and closed malls in America.\n","trip":"Japan 2017","place":"Japan","timezone":"Japan","location":"Ghibli Museum","title":"Day 1: Ghibli Museum","description":"The Ghibli Museum (三鷹の森ジブリ美術館, Mitaka no Mori Jiburi Bijutsukan, Mitaka Forest Ghibli Museum) showcases the work of Studio Ghibli, a Japanese animation studio.","date":"2017-03-22T04:00:07.000Z","image":{"src":"/japan-2017/_astro/Entrance.CVU4gl7u.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/japan-2017/src/assets/gallery/01-ghibli-museum/Entrance.jpeg"},"map":[35.69622,139.57043,18],"tags":["museum","Studio Ghibli","Tokyo"]},{"id":"01-tokyo.md","slug":"01-tokyo","base":"/japan-2017/","collection":"post","body":"\n## Arrival in Tokyo\n\nArrival in Tokyo was via Haneda airport, just as the sun rose. I pretty much slept all the way from take off to breakfast. Because I had dinner beforehand at the Qantas lounge, I asked the flight attendants not to disturb me and skipped the meal service.\n\nWe are so excited to return to Japan after almost a decade since the previous trip. This time we will be more adventurous and visit places outside the major cities.\n\nAfter the plan landed, we paid over 1000 yen at the airport to get a shower but it was oh so worth it. We tried to get a SIM card for the iPad but it didn’t work. So, apart from airport wifi, we were without internet all the way to the hotel.\n\nWe weren’t sure we were on the right train. My first task was to muster enough courage and recall enough Japanese to ask our fellow passengers. Fortunately an old woman understood me and was quite helpful in ensuring we got off at the right spot.\n\nWithout internet, it was hard to figure out how to get to the hotel. I had a rough idea from the map at the station but not sure which was the best way. We found a koban (police box) and I asked for directions in my best Japanese. I was surprised I still retained enough Japanese to understand the policeman’s directions. Reached the hotel safely, we received our tickets and wifi router and we were finally reconnected.\n\n## Tokyo Station\n\nUsing Apple Maps we managed to navigate the complex Tokyo transport system. On arrival in Tokyo Station, we exchanged our Japan Rail passes and reserved all our Shinkansen journeys.\n\nTokyo Station is located in Chiyoda’s Marunouchi business district near the Imperial Palace grounds. It is the busiest station in Japan. The older part of the station is labelled Marunouchi, and the newer Eastern extension is labelled Yaesu, not far from the Ginza commercial district.\n\nAfter that we headed to Mitaka for the [Ghibli museum](https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/).\n","trip":"Japan 2017","place":"Japan","timezone":"Japan","location":"Tokyo","title":"Day 1: Tokyo","description":"Our return to Japan after nearly a decade!

We tried registering for one attraction and was dismayed to discover the earliest time it gave us was 8:30 pm.\n\nThen we saw people were queueing up 2 hours in advance for a show. The waiting time for popular attractions ranged from 2-4 hours! Holy LEGO Batman!\n\nWe ended up choosing all the attractions that didn’t have a long waiting time. This includes riding on a themed classic car, riding the train, the boat, plus the Sinbad version of the Its A Small World boat ride in Disneyland.

Walt Disney originally envisioned a nautical counterpart to Disneyland, but it was never built in his lifetime due to problems with Euro Disney.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n> Tokyo DisneySea (東京ディズニーシー) is a theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort located in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, just outside Tokyo. It opened on 4 September 2001, at a cost of 335 billion yen. The Oriental Land Company owns the park, and licenses Disney characters and themes from The Walt Disney Company. With a size of 176-acre (71.22 ha), Tokyo DisneySea attracted nearly fifteen million visitors in 2018, making it the fourth-most-visited theme park in the world.\n>\n> _Wikipedia_\n\nThe official website is available in [English](http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tds/).\n\n## Journey\n\nWe woke up and had breakfast at the hotel. We have stayed in many “business class” hotels in Japan 9 years ago and know that the quality and variety of what is offered for breakfast can range from basic to amazing. On this scale, the breakfast was at least 8 out of 10. I had a selection of Japanese dishes including my favourite chawan mushi but they even had kare (curry). They also had a full range of Western dishes – I tried the bacon and sausages and they were both delicious. Since I knew I will be skipping lunch I had extra large helpings. The coffee was from a machine and was okay. By the time I finished, I was waddling out with a full belly.\n\nThe journey there involved changing across three sets of trains plus a short walk between stations. Once again Apple Maps proved to be very useful. It knew all the underground connections and even gave us a shortcut not officially signposted. We were lucky enough to catch a Rapid train which halved the journey time to the Disney Resort Gateway. After that we boarded the Disney line which featured cute Mickey Mouse shaped windows (like the similar train in Hong Kong).\n\n## Afterwards\n\nWe finished around 6pm and didn’t want to stay for the night show and fireworks. We were ravenous by that time but the food in the resort was at rip off expensive prices. What is worse is when we left, they force us to go through floors of shops just so that they can have one final chance to rip us from our money. We finally reached the JR Maihama station with vending machines that sold drinks at normal prices!\n\nWe waited around 15 mins for an express train (local slow trains were every few mins) and it was worth it – the journey took less than 20 mins to get to Tokyo station. On the way back we experienced the subway at peak hour. Wow it’s true they do pack people in like sardines! We could barely squeeze into the train but luckily the platform attendant didn’t have to push people in.\n\nFor dinner, we were tempted to eat at Tokyo station but decided to head back to Asakusa for an unagi meal. We were in a very small and homely restaurant but the owners were very nice – I felt like I was back in time to a 60s Japanese movie.\n","trip":"Japan 2017","place":"Japan","timezone":"Japan","location":"Tokyo DisneySea","title":"Day 2: DisneySea","description":"Today we are visiting DisneySea, a unique nautically oriented theme park, unlike the other Disney theme parks around the world.","date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","image":{"src":"/japan-2017/_astro/Chris Globe.DAdGZ_8K.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/japan-2017/src/assets/gallery/02-disneysea-general/Chris Globe.jpeg"},"map":[35.6268,139.8723,14],"tags":["DisneySea","theme park","Tokyo"]},{"id":"03-kurashiki.md","slug":"03-kurashiki","base":"/japan-2017/","collection":"post","body":"\nKurashiki (倉敷市) is a city located in western Okayama Prefecture.\n\n## Bikan Historical Area\n\nKurashiki has a preserved canal area that dates back to the Edo Period, when the city served as an important rice distribution center. In fact, “Kurashiki” roughly translates to “town of storehouses” in reference to the rice storehouses.\n\nMany of Kurashiki’s former storehouses are now museums, boutiques and cafes. The Ohara Museum is the most impressive of Kurashiki’s museums, exhibiting a large collection of works by famous Western artists. We didn’t go in, but admired the statues on the outside.\n\nThe entire area looks like it could be a film location for a historic Japanese drama. Apparently the city has removed power poles to try to make the area appear more historical.\n\nSome of the buildings in this area include:\n\n- Archaeological Museum\n  ![Archaeological Museum](../../assets/gallery/03-kurashiki/Kurashiki_Archeological_Museum.jpeg)\n- Kurashikikan (Tourist Information Office)\n  ![Kurashikikan](../../assets/gallery/03-kurashiki/Kake_Museum_of_Art.jpeg)\n- Ohashi House\n- Ohara Museum of Art\n  ![Ohara Museum of Art](../../assets/gallery/03-kurashiki/Ohara_Museum_of_Art.jpeg)\n- Shinkei-en Garden\n- Ohara House\n  ![Ohara House](../../assets/gallery/03-kurashiki/Former_Ohara_residence.jpeg)\n- Yurinso Villa\n- Museum of Folkcraft\n  ![Museum of Folkcraft](../../assets/gallery/03-kurashiki/Kurashiki_Museum_of_Folk_Craft.jpeg)\n\nUnfortunately due to the cold winter the trees along the canal haven’t blossomed yet but it was still charming and we saw lots of “gondoliers” taking tourists out for a spin on the boats. The boat tour only takes 20 mins and relatively inexpensive (500 yen). There was a moment of excitement as a bird flew closely past one of the boats.\n\nThere is a tourist information site in [English](https://www.kurashiki-tabi.jp/for/en/).\n\nWe wished we could have stayed longer, but we have to head towards Okayama before nightfall. I discovered afterwards there is a covered shopping street linking the station to the canal. We just walked on the main road, which is still interesting because of the topiary along the way.

The Shinkansen train from Tokyo to Okayama leaves the is due at 8:03. We waited for the breakfast buffet to open at 6:45 and wolfed down a full brekky. I took only 20 mins to finish my breakfast. I noticed this old Japanese guy next to me managed to guzzle through two hot plates in 10 mins!\n\nWe now consider ourselves seasoned Tokyo subway travellers. We jostle up and down stairways with the commuters. Miraculously, we made it to Tokyo station within 15 mins, despite having to change lines (and stations).\n\nThe journey on the Shinkansen was pretty uneventful. I noted the countryside seems far more developed than 9 years ago. I barely saw any farmland it seemed like an unbroken stretch of suburbia for hundreds of km.\n\nWe arrived at Okayama at around 12:30 and I bought some Hello Kitty souvenirs from the gift shop. One of them was Hello Kitty coming out of a giant peach. This is a reference to the Momotaro legend associated with the town.\n\n## Okayama Castle\n\nOkayama Castle (岡山城) is a Japanese castle in the city of Okayama. It was originally completed in 1597 but partially destroyed in World War II and reconstructed in 1966. Two of the watch towers survived the bombing of 1945. They are now listed by the national Agency for Cultural Affairs as Important Cultural Properties.\n\nThe castle has a nickname of Crow Castle (烏城) or “castle of the black bird”. Gilded fish-shaped-gargoyles feature prominently on the roof. At one stage the castle had gilded roof tiles as well, earning it the nickname Golden Crow Castle (金烏城).\n\nThe outside of the castle was spectacular. I was a bit disappointed when I went inside the castle for a tour. It has a very modern and concrete interior. The interior is a museum documenting the castle's history.\n","trip":"Japan 2017","place":"Japan","timezone":"Japan","location":"Okayama Castle","title":"Day 3: Okayama (Okayama Castle)","description":"Okayama Castle (岡山城), located in Okayama Japan, was completed in 1597, destroyed during World War II, and reconstructed in 1966.","date":"2017-03-24T05:00:54.000Z","image":{"src":"/japan-2017/_astro/Chris Okayama Castle.CXu5M2gD.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1701,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/japan-2017/src/assets/gallery/03-okayama-castle/Chris Okayama Castle.jpeg"},"map":[34.66521,133.93606,17],"tags":["historic","attraction","castle","Okayama Castle","Okayama"]},{"id":"03-okayama-korakuen.md","slug":"03-okayama-korakuen","base":"/japan-2017/","collection":"post","body":"\nWe decided to visit the Kōraku-en (後楽園) garden in Okayama next to the castle.

The original appearance has survived until today in more, with a few changes made along the way.\n\nThe design is designed in the Kaiyu (“scenic promenade”) style. Every turn of the path presents the visitor with a unique view, connecting the lawns, ponds, hills, tea houses, and streams.\n\nIn addition, and rather unique for a Japanese garden, there are spacious lawns. Also found in the garden are groves of plum, cherry and maple trees, tea and rice fields, an archery range and a crane aviary.\n\nFrom Yuishinzan Hill, there is an observation platform where it is possible to command a panoramic view of the garden.\nKorakuen garden contains a number of buildings:\n\n- Enyo-tei House\n- Jizo-do Shrine\n  ![Jizo-do Shrine](../../assets/gallery/03-okayama-korakuen/Jizo_do_temple.jpeg)\n- Ryuten rest house\n- Jigen-do Shrine\n  ![Jigen-do Shrine](../../assets/gallery/03-okayama-korakuen/Jigen_do_temple_3.jpeg)\n- Noh stage and Eisho\n- Renchi-ken rest house\n  ![Renchi-ken rest house](../../assets/gallery/03-okayama-korakuen/Renchi_Ken_rest_house.jpeg)\n- Chaso-do tea house\n\nFrom some parts of the garden, Okayama Castle can be observed in the distance.\n\nThe main pond (Sawa-no-ike) contains a number of artificial and decorative islands.

It's formal name is Itsukushima (厳島).\n\nThe famous O-Torii gate is part of Itsukushima Shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nItsukushima has a number of temples, including Toyokuni Shrine with a five-storied pagoda, and Daiganji Temple – one of the three most famous Benzaiten temples of Japan.\n\nSeto Inland Sea is affected by strong tides. At low tide, water no longer cover the island’s torii bottom, which can disappoint tourists. At high tide, the sea covers all the previously exposed seabed mud and fills areas underneath the shrine boardwalk.\n\nThe tourism guide for Miyajima is available in [English](https://www.miyajima.or.jp/english/).\n\n## Journey to Miyajima\n\nWe reached the island via a train ride, then a ferry. Both train and ferry to the island was crowded as we went on a weekend.\n\n![JR Ferry](../../assets/gallery/04-miyajima/JR_Ferry_3.jpeg)\n\nUpon arrival, we followed the horde of people heading for Miyajima the shrine and the torii gate built on the shallow sea bed.

These are pretty tame and obviously trained to listen to the sound of rustling bags. I think the deer were very disappointed we did not have any shika senbei (deer crackers) with us. I managed to pet a few and they are very docile.\n\n![Deer](../../assets/gallery/04-miyajima/Deer_1.jpeg)\n\n## Itsukushima Shrine\n\nThe Itsukushima shrine is one of Japan’s most popular tourist attractions.

The shrine complex itself consists of two main buildings: the Honsha shrine and the Sessha Marodo-jinja, as well as 17 other different buildings and structures that help to distinguish it.

It seemed to have pretty decent food and prices that were almost reasonable. We stopped and had two bowls of udon to give us energy for the mountain. The ropeway station was not too crowded but I was surprised how long the journey was. Its broken into two segments and two types of cable cars.

The Jurassic ride is water based and quite splashy based on the drenched look of the participants. The roller coaster seems very terrifying with lots of twists turns and corkscrews.

Regretfully, she informed us that the trees haven’t fully bloomed yet (she said only about 50%, even though the cherry blossom forecast said they should be in full bloom by now). We asked her for the best place to view the blossom, and she suggested the nearby Shinjuku Gyoen.\n\nSince we were planning to go there tomorrow anyway, we thought we’ll try the Imperial Palace East Garden, so we headed out on the Yamanote line. I forgot how slow the service is, and it took us quite a while and many stops to get there, but at least the journey is covered by our Japan Rail Pass, which expires today.\n\nThe Tokyo Imperial Palace (皇居, Kōkyo, literally 'Imperial Residence') is the main residence of the Emperor of Japan. The East Gardens are publicly accessible.\n\nJust outside the entrance to the East Gardens, I was pleased to see some cherry trees on the boulevard. However, inside the gardens, I can tell most of the trees haven’t awakened yet, but we did find some trees that have blossomed early.\n\nIt was a nice warm day, probably the first that I could unzip my jacket. We walked all around the garden. I was a little disappointed that I could not get into the Imperial Palace, but it is after all the royal residence.\n\nThe East Gardens is where most of the administrative buildings for the palace are located . Located on the grounds of the East Gardens is the Imperial Tokagakudo Music Hall, the Music Department of the Board of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household, the Archives and Mausolea Department Imperial Household Agency, structures for the guards such as the Saineikan dojo, and the Museum of the Imperial Collections.\n","trip":"Japan 2017","place":"Japan","timezone":"Japan","location":"Imperial Palace East Garden","title":"Day 9: Tokyo (Imperial Palace East Garden)","description":"The Imperial Palace East Gardens encompasses the former Honmaru and Ninomaru areas of Edo Castle and the Imperial Tokagakudo Music Hall.","date":"2017-03-30T01:00:43.000Z","image":{"src":"/japan-2017/_astro/Ninomaru garden.x9IQyNzc.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1,"fsPath":"/Volumes/Dev/Repositories/travelens/japan-2017/src/assets/gallery/09-tokyo-imperial-palace-east-garden/Ninomaru garden.jpeg"},"map":[35.6819,139.7619,14],"tags":["East Garden","garden","Imperial Palace","Tokyo"]},{"id":"10-tokyo-haneda-airport.md","slug":"10-tokyo-haneda-airport","base":"/japan-2017/","collection":"post","body":"\nWe arrived at Haneda airport, and wandered around the airport shopping area until it was time to check in.

This is a huge park about 15 mins walk from the station. Even though it was still relatively early, there were already lots of people at the park.\n\nI was surprised that the park charged an admission fee of 200 yen. Once we were inside though, it was worth it. Plenty of cherry blossoms, and lots of tourists like us taking photos. The Tokyo natives were smarter, they headed deeper into the park where the trees are more mature and the blossom is even more enticing.\n\nThe park was originally a residence of the Naitō family in the Edo period. Afterwards, it became a garden under the management of the Imperial Household Agency of Japan. It is now a national park under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment.\n\nWe spent pretty much the whole morning at the park, and there were lots to see, including a Japanese garden, a French formal garden and English landscape garden.
